Find how many ones are present in that if the 1's count value is greater
 the last digit return the last number otherwise print the 1's count.

âœ… Part 2: Minimum Operations in an Array

 Example: Minimum operations to make all elements equal by incrementing or decrementing (typical interview problem)
Logic: Choose the median as target. Each step is |element - median|. Sum it up.

def min_operations_to_equal(arr):
    arr.sort()
    median = arr[len(arr) // 2]

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]
print(min_operations_to_equal(arr))  # Output: 4
